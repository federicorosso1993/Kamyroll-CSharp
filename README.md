Simple C# conversion of https://github.com/hyugogirubato/Kamyroll-Python
It will be a little different from the original source to be as basic as possible (it will not store any config.json and it will not support download seasons and movies (just simple episode)) it will only Login and Download at the same time (or better, display the info that youtube need to download).
Apache License 2.0 the same as the original apply to Kamyroll-CSharp.

I made this to study the way Crunchyroll Beta API works and to create a better way to find any API call type without testing.

Right now the Download part is missing (there are comments of the original python code converted to C# with an automatic tool), I'm not sure I will complete this concept.
